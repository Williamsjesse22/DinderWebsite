				<p class="developer-description">
					Dinder was created by Jesse Williams, a Software Engineer at
					Iowa State University. I have a passion for solving problems
					and my goal is to make the world a better place through
					technology.
				</p>
				<p class="developer-description">
					With 9 older siblings, all with varying dietary
					accommodations and preferences, Googling "food near me" was
					no longer cutting it. So, I saught out to find a better way
					to choose a restaurant that takes both your accommodations
					and prefences seriously and weighs them accordningly.
					Through the help of many friends and family, the idea for
					Dinder was born late one night in my freshman dorm room.
				</p>
				<p class="developer-description">
					With endless support from those around me, this eccentric
					idea has finally come to reality. Dinder is a culmination of
					my passion for technology, problem-solving, and the desire
					to make dining out a more enjoyable experience for everyone.
					Come with me on this journey to revolutionize the way we
					choose where to eat through Dinder: the end of dinner
					debates!
